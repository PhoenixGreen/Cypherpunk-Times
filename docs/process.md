# Writing Process

(First process draft proposed 2023-12-28)

1. Before writing an article, an author proposes the article to be written in the writer's channel. If it gets two thumbs up, it’s cleared to be written. This step should also help reduce duplication of similar articles.

2. Posting questions and ideas for an article. It could also be a good idea for an author to post questions for an article before writing. There is a wealth of knowledge in the writer's channel which might help with the depth and critical thinking aspects of an article. This could also be a good idea to try to gain multiple perspectives on a topic.

3. After writing the article, the preview link from cypherpunktimes.com, for the article draft, is then posted to the writer channel for review. This gives community members and other writers the chance to have a read of the article and add constructive criticism. I’m also thinking of adding at least one paid reviewer to help with this work load. Once reviewed, the author makes the necessary changes.

4. Once the review process is complete, I’ll conduct a final proofread and publish.

5. Post publication. Once published, the writer creates a twitter post and shares the link in the social media channel, so the community can comment, like and retweet. I’m also thinking of expanding this section to other platforms and incentivising writers to participate. I haven’t worked out the details yet.
