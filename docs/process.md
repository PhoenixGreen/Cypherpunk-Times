# Writing Process

(Second process draft proposed 2024-01-03)

1. Pre-production: Writers propose an article to be written, in the writer's channel on Matrix. Which should also include a short thesis statement and a simple bullet point outline. If the article suggested gets a combined vote of two or more, it’s cleared to be written.

Side note: Matrix threads could be a suitable solution to help collate the participating votes.

2. Pre-production: It might also be a good idea to post questions to ask for ideas. There is a wealth of knowledge in the writer's channel which might help with the depth and critical thinking aspects of an article. This could also be a good way to gain multiple perspectives on a topic.

3. Production: write the article…

4. Review: After writing the article, the preview link from cypherpunktimes.com, is then posted to the writers channel for review. This gives community members and other writers the chance to have a read of the article and add constructive criticism. Once reviewed, the author makes the necessary changes ready for publishing. This might need two rounds of review if the edit is considerable.

Side note: Matrix threads or Git will likely be the best places to conduct the review process so it doesn’t overwhelm the main writer's channel.

5. Proofreading: Once the review process is complete, a final proofread is conducted and the article is published.

6. Post publication: Once published, the writer creates a twitter post and shares the link on the “DCR Social Media” channel on Matrix. This gives the wider community an opportunity to engage with the article, adding comments, likes and retweets.
