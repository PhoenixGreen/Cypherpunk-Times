# Writing process

(Third process draft proposed 2024-01-28)


## Cypherpunk Times writing process

Cypherpunk Times has implemented the following process with the aim of building a writing culture that seeks to produce engaging, high-quality content. To achieve this, we’ve identified key areas that need to be address. Including reducing article churn, improving our review process and connecting with the wider community.

New writers aiming to join the team or wanting to submit articles to the platform, should also follow the below steps. We are constantly looking for new talented writers, but before joining the team, the expectation is that you’ll demonstrate by doing and become an active member of the writer's channel.

## Writing process in-depth


### Stage 1: Discussion and planning

Writers propose an article to be written using the “Cypherpunk Times Articles” GitHub repo. Copy the link for this new document to the writer's channel on Matrix, to include the community in the discussions.

Article discussion should include:

* Title
* Headline / featured text
* Thesis statement
* Bullet point structural outline
* Opportunity for discussion, questions, idea development, points of views and talking points

If the article suggested is contentious or considered outside the scope of the publication, it will need a combined vote of +2 or more to be cleared to be written.


### Stage 2: Create article

Using the developments from stage one, create your article to the outlined specification. Criteria to consider:

* Article length. 1400+ words (anything shorter than this tends to lack depth)
* Images / data. Generally, 1 to 3 images is more than adequate to help engage the reader
* Structure. Does the article have a consistent structure that flows and is focused?
* Do the talking points engage the reader?
* Is the piece non-biased and consider a range of factors?
* Research and fact check before submitting for review
* Final spelling and grammar checks


### Stage 3: Review

After writing the article, Share the GitHub pull request link to your article for review in the writer's channel.

This gives community members and other writers the chance to have a read of the article and add constructive criticism. Once reviewed, the author makes the necessary changes ready for publishing. This might need two rounds of review if the edit is considerable.

What should reviewers be checking for?

* Structural flow, consistency, and topic focus
* Sentence and paragraph structures
* Grammar and spelling errors
* Over use of repetition
* Is the article engaging?
* Does the article demonstrate critical thinking and challenge mainstream narratives?
* Does the article have a suitable cypherpunk tone?


### Stage 4: Social media

Once published, the writer creates social media posts and shares links on the “DCR Social Media” channel on Matrix. This gives the wider community an opportunity to engage with the article, adding comments, likes and retweets etc.

What social media content should writers create?

* Twitter — Initial tweet from writers' Twitter account, maybe do this as a thread and put the link on the last post. They could also schedule a tweet a few days later, perhaps with a poll attached to increase engagement.
* Reddit — Post article excerpt and link to Decred’s reddit page to get more interaction on this platform
* Bison Relay — Post the full article to the Bison Relay News feed.
* (Optional) Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok — have generally been low engagement platforms for Decred, but this could also be an opportunity to increase engagement on these platforms
* Comments — Where applicable, start the discussion in the comment section (Cypherpunk Times, Bison Relay, Reddit). This could be a good opportunity to ask questions, e.g. What would you do …?
