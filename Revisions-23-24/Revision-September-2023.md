* Communications - Tallamericano is now helping to manage and produce content for the cypherpunktimes twitter account. The idea is they will work with the Vanguard group to coordinate social media efforts. 
* Creator onboarding - I've reached out to several creators and communites to add content to CT including Dash, Siacoin, Digibyte, Zcash. Firo is still the only project actively engaging with the project. I'm aining to start bringing in content as part of the editors role, to get the ball rolling. I just need the given permissions.
