* Communications - This month I've been working on a new system for the writer review process with the aim to improve our content
* This month I've brought on @zippycorners as an official reviewer for Cypherpunk Times to help with the review process.
  His technical expertise and structural analysis has already started to come in very useful 

## Social Media Posts 
Reporting Structure: Post Title – link
* As part of the review process I'm aiming to include the writers into the social media content creation. This should do a few things.
* Firstly expose us to more users as most of our writers are verified.
* Secondly this approach will add more voices to the narrative
* Thirdly this routine should build a better relationship between the writers and the community.
* This process is still in its early stages and we'll iron out any issues as we go
