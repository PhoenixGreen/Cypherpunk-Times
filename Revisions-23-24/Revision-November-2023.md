## Site Admin
This month, our @decredmagazine Twitter account has been permanently banned. I have provided Twitter with the information they asked for, but unfortunately, their banning service has not responded. Reason for banning action — impersonation.

On a separate Twitter event. The platform we use for social media campaigns can no longer deliver posts to the platform. I believe Twitter is in the process of reducing the number of posts people can make from automated services.

Going forward, I aim to firstly start manually posting all of our social media content. With a strategy of incentivising authors to take up the mantle of creating their own social media campaigns for their cypherpunk times articles. As I work out the details, I’ll do a follow-up.

Please note that all previously created campaigns will no longer be delivered from the missingletter platform to Twitter or Facebook.
